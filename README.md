**FILM SCRAPER** is web scraping app that uses [THE FILM STAGE](https://thefilmstage.com/) as it's resource. It gets news pertaining to the film industry, displays them on the page, and also stores it in a Database.

### INSTRUCTIONS 
Navigate your way to the home page by using the link provided above. Cycle through the most current and up to date news about what's going down in the film industry. There are two sources we are pulling from. The hottest news is usually displayed in the jumbotron. Below there is other news displayed in some nice cards. Find which ones you like and click save. Head to the save paged to see which articles you have stored. If you want, you can click comment and leave some thoughts you had about the article or movie. Delete if you no longer want to keep those around. And if you are done with the article all together click delete and it will be removed from the database. Head back to the home page and click the clear button if you want to clear the database altogether.
